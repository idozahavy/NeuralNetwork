Self Learning
from the situation(input_nodes) the neural will make a decision to act on something which will make a new situation
the neural network will take an emotion to the new situation
the emotion is the cost function (good emotion = low cost , bad emotion = big cost)
reacts to the new situation and so on

>>>>>>>Reinforcement Learning
making the neural better only by the cost at the end of the situation
scoring the outcome of the neural decisions to make the cost efficient

> Mutation Shake - if experiencing the vanishing gradient problem,
make the values shake a bit and then backpropagate again
